# cub3D

#### Finished in: 2025-04-12

This project was done in partnership with [Mariana Morais](https://github.com/marianaobmorais))

## About

Cub3D is a simple 3D game engine developed in C, inspired by the classic Wolfenstein 3D. It was built as part of the 42 School curriculum to deepen our understanding of low-level graphics programming, raycasting, and real-time rendering.

The objective was to simulate a first-person view inside a maze using a raycasting algorithm. We implemented dynamic player movement, wall collisions, a minimap, texture mapping, and sprites — all rendered in a 2D context with 3D-like visuals using MiniLibX, a lightweight graphics library.

## Build

Clone the repository: 
```shell
git clone https://github.com/marianaobmorais/cub3d.git
```
Enter the cloned directory:
```shell
cd cub3d
```
Run `make` to compile the program:
```shell
make bonus
```
## Usage
Start the program – choose any valid map as argument:
```shell
./cub3D_bonus assets/maps/valid/subject_map_bonus.cub
```
Follow screen instructions: `press enter`

### Controls

### Message to students

If you are searching resources to learn more about your own cub3D, I encourage you to turn to your peers and the function manuals. Do not implement any code you do not understand and cannot code from scratch.
